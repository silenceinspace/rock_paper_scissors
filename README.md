# rock_paper_scissors
Well, this first javascript project took me some time. While working on it, I had to slow down with programming a bit. So I forgot certain things especially in css and html (flexbox and semantic html elements). However, I did make it just in time before my university starts. All in all, it's like a solid conclusion of my 3-ish months with programming.

What I will carry away from this project:

1. HTML:
- the importance of putting my js code in the right place, so that dom can function properly (alternatively "defer" attribute in the script element)
- any page does consist of many blocks(divs), which makes different manipulations with files much easier
- not overusing classes and ids for elements
- custom attribute (data-...)for making up my own html attributes

2. CSS:
- always add the css reset for a file
- make sure to use (min-height: 100vh) in the body part so that it covers the whole page
- using (flex-direction:column in the body) for the footer to stay at the bottom
- creating dropdown menus on hover (still need to understand the "position" property a bit better, difference between absolute and relative positions)
- hover helpful text over images with animation (should look up some info about :before)
- scale elements with a little nice transition

3. JS:
- create a function with random outcomes (math functions)
- storing data in variables + keeping them in appropriate scopes 
- work with arrays and loops
- event listeners (event object "e" with different properties)
- conditional statements (if/switch)
- DOM (working with html and css elements/creating new elements/removing something)
- how to refresh the page by clicking a button

Amazing and useful experience. It also showed me how important it is being okay with bugs and trying to come up with solutions. Making a new project is more about rational thinking and understanding why something should be done/removed. So as long as I am aware of my code's mission, it doesn't matter how long it takes me.
